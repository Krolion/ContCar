  — The car learning to maximize score (last 2876 generations,  Learning.jpg)\n
Every strategy consists of n parts, dependind on starting point.\n
"Learning.jpg" shows maximal reached distance for different starting points \n
"Learning2.jpg" shows maximal score for different starting points (two lines) and score for random starting point (dots)\n
